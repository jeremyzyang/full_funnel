    "## Simulation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains **Python code** to model user behavior as they move through a marketing funnel, influenced by different types of advertisements. The data generated will be used for analysis in `analysis.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Funnel Stages\n",
    "The funnel consists of four distinct stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Not Aware**  \n",
    "2. **Aware**  \n",
    "3. **Consider**  \n",
    "4. **Purchase**\n",
    "\n",
    "Users progress through these stages sequentially and probabilistically over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advertisement Types\n",
    "Two types of advertisements are presented to users:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Branding Ads**  \n",
    "- **Performance Ads**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each ad type may have a different impact on user progression through the funnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Behavior \n",
    "- Each user can make up to **four visits**.\n",
    "- In each visit, the user is **exposed to one advertisement**.\n",
    "- Between visits, users may **progress to the next stage** in the funnel.\n",
    "- Users are only eligible to **make a purchase** when they reach the **Purchase** stage.\n",
    "- Once a user completes a purchase, they **no longer continue** to make visits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation includes a **randomized experiment** with five distinct conditions. Each condition determines the type and sequence of ads shown to users during their visits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Control Group\n",
    "- **No advertisement** is shown at any stage.\n",
    "- Serves as a baseline for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Branding Group\n",
    "- Users are shown a **branding ad** during **every visit**, regardless of their funnel stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Performance Group\n",
    "- Users are shown a **performance ad** during **every visit**, regardless of their funnel stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Brand-Plus-Performance Group\n",
    "- Users are shown:\n",
    "  - A **branding ad** during the **first two visits** (if applicable).\n",
    "  - A **performance ad** during the **third and fourth visits** (if applicable).\n",
    "- Ad exposure is based on the **visit sequence**, not the user's funnel stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Full-Funnel Group\n",
    "- Ad type is determined by the **user's current funnel stage**:\n",
    "  - **Branding ad** if the user is in the **Not Aware** stage.\n",
    "  - **Performance ad** if the user is in the **Aware**, **Consider**, or **Purchase** stages."
