# full_funnel
The repo contains two notebooks that simulate and analyze a full-funnel advertising experiment. 

The data is illustrative in nature and may not correspond to the companyâ€™s actual circumstances.

## Notebook Overview

---

### 1. `simulation.ipynb`
- Contains Python code to **simulate experimental data** for various ad campaigns.
- Simulation parameters can be modified by **instructors** as needed.

### 2. `analysis.ipynb`
- Uses R to analyze the simulated data generated in the simulation notebook.
- Intended for **students** to analyze the data without access to the simulation logic.
- Can be shared with students **afterward as a solution reference**.

---

### Access Guidelines
- **Instructors**: Should have access to both `simulation.ipynb` and `analysis.ipynb`.
- **Students**: Should only receive the **simulated dataset** initially. The `analysis.ipynb` can be shared later as the official solution.
